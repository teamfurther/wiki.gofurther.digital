These names will be updated in the event of a material change or when one of Contact Persons leaves the firm.

### Customer's Right to Functional Software[#](#business-continuity-functional-software)
In case the software runs on customer's server, Further Digital Solutions (C4WEB STUDIO SRL) has no responsibility for the correct functioning of software.

In other cases, Further always employs the services of Linode LLC for the hosting of the software. In the case of a serious business disruption (SBD), clients may turn directly to the above noted firms.

  
### Data Backup and Recovery[#](#business-continuity-data-backup-recovery)
