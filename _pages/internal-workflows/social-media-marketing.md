## Branding[#](#branding)
Whenever possible, social media posts should be branded (logo, colors, fonts, imagery).

### Resources[#](#branding-resources)
- Brand guidelines [&#x2197;](http://bit.ly/2k0sqhl){:target="_blank"}

## Grid Planning[#](#grid-planning)
Grid planning is a tool that helps us maintain a consistent posting schedule across different social media channels. Grid planning shall be executed monthly.

To create the grid plan, we use a Google Spreadsheet document [found here](http://bit.ly/2k0sqhl){:target="_blank"}.

On the X axis (lettered) you can find the different [social media channels](#social-media-channels) we post to.  
On the Y axis (numbered) you can find the calendar days in the months, accompanied by the different [topics](#topics).

It is not obligatory to post in all 7 topics each week, but it is advisable to post at least 5x / week.
Some topics like ```Tip day``` or ```Created content``` should be posted each week.
