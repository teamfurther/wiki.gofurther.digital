These are our company wiki pages. This is where we store internal documentation about processes and workflows. The contents of this site exist for ourselves —more importantly, our future selves— and for giving future colleagues a reference to our way of doing things and their quirks.

The purpose is to:
- help faster onboarding of new team members
- reduce time spent on searching for information
- ensure that knowledge doesn't leave with people
