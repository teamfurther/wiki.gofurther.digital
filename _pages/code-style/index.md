<p class="is-text-large">The following pages describe the use of coding rules adhered to while writing awesome code for C4studio.</p>

Why all this fuss and bother over how we write code?
- it increases code development and debugging speed
- it makes code more maintainable
- it makes code more readable, every line of code should appear to be written by a single person, no matter the number of contributors
- it encourages the you to pay attention to the little details
- it helps to foster an environment of "accountability for your own code"
