When development begings on a new project, we need to go through numerous steps to ensure our work is efficient, timelines can be met, and product quality assured. We keep these steps in a checklist:

- Do we have a JIRA backlog of user stories?
- Do we have sprint planning for first sprint?
- Do we have a Risk Assessment Matrix? **If not, create one!**
- Do we have a Toggl project set-up?
- Do we have a Slack channel set-up?
- Do we have a GIT repo set-up? **If not, do it!**
- Do we have a server set-up? **If not, do it!**
- Do we have Docker local environment set-up to match server config? **If not, do it!**
- Do we have Laravel Debugbar configured? **If not, do it!**
- Do we have an IPS set-up? **If not, do it!**
