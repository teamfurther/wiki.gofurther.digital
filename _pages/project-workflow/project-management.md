During the lifetime of a project, we need to go through numerous steps to ensure our work is efficient, timelines can be met, and product quality assured. We keep these steps in a checklist:

### Before kick-off[#](#project-management-before)
- Do we have a backlog of user stories?
- Do we have sprint planning for first sprint?
- Do we have a Risk Assessment Matrix? **If not, create one!**
- Do we have a Toggl project set-up?
- Do we have a Slack channel set-up?
- Do we have a GIT repo set-up? **If not, do it!**
- Do we have a server with CI/CD set-up? **If not, do it!**
- Do we have an IPS set-up? **If not, do it!**
- Do we have a project document repo? **If not, do it!**

### During project[#](#project-management-during)
- Is user story backlog up-to-date?
- Do we have sprint planning for next sprint?
- Is project repo up-to-date?

### Client calls, meetings[#](#project-management-meetings)
