Even before an offer goes out to a client or a contract is signed, a lot of steps have to be taken to ensure the budgets and deadlines are realistic, and product quality can be assured.

## Sending Quotations[#](#sending-quotations)
- Creating quotation should be done using our estimate template [&#x2197;](http://bit.ly/2n1bRmu){:target="_blank"}
- Estimates - whenever possible -  should be done by **at least two team members** using **planning poker**.
- Estimates should be made for the following activities:
    - Specification
    - Wireframing
    - Design
    - Sitebuild    
    - Development <small>(broken down into subtasks of no more than 8 hours)</small>    
    - Automated testing    
    - Code reviews
    - Data migration
    - DevOps    
    - Documentation <small>(do they require up-to-date class diagrams / data models / api docs?)</small>
    - Manual testing
    - PM
- Estimated hours for each development subtask should fit in slots of 1, 2, 4, 8 hours
- Estimate should be transformed into quotations, using our quotations template [HU] [&#x2197;](http://bit.ly/2m6noAS){:target="_blank"} [EN] [&#x2197;](http://bit.ly/2mZakxp){:target="_blank"}

<small class="note">When estimating, take into consideration what the team will look like, what their competencies are and if they require extra time to learn a new tech stack.</small>
