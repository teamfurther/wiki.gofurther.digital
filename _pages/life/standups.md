## Stand-up meetings[#](#stand-up)
Daily stand-up meetings help better communication between team members. In a remote team it is especially important to chart who is working on which project and what task.

- we meet on Google Meet (link is pinned in ```#general``` Slack channel) at 10:00 (RO) every day (Monday to Friday)
- to motivate people not to be late, the person who joined the latest, opens the meeting
- succinctly tell us what you worked on last workday, what you're planning on doing today and if you have any blockers
- if you have a blocker and can not continue work, this is the best time to ask for help
- everybody's time is precious, so try not to wander and discuss detailed questions about certain projects in private conversations

## Drum-roll meetings[#](#drum-roll)

- every Monday stand-up is a special meeting, called a drum-roll meeting
- instead of telling us what you worked on last workday and what you're planning on working today, we concentrate on our current deadlines
- list all the deadlines for your current projects
- if any of your current projects doesn't have a deadline, treat it as a red flag and discuss it with PM
- if you have blockers, mention them at the end of the drum-roll meeting
