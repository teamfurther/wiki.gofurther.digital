Daily stand-up meetings help better communication between team members. In a remote team it is especially important to chart who is working on which project and what task.

- we meet on Google Hangouts (link is pinned in ```#default``` Slack channel) at 10:00 (RO) every day (Monday to Friday)
- to motivate people not to be late, the person who joined the latest, opens the meeting
- succinctly tell us what you worked on last workday, what you're planning on doing today and if you have any blockers
- if you have a blocker and can not continue work, this is the best time to ask for help
- everybody's time is precious, so try not to wander and discuss detailed questions about certain projects in private conversations
