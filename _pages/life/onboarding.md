## Holidays[#](#holidays)
Here at Further, we have opted for an open vacation policy, which basically means that you can take time off whenever you need it (granted that you are aware of your responsibilities when it comes to other team members’ work). Feeling “out of it” or generally unmotivated is enough of a reason to take a day or two. It helps you recharge in a period when you would not be productive anyways.

There's only one rule: if you're taking more than 2 days, make sure you announce it as early as possible (preferable 3-4 weeks earlier) and you set yourself as unavailable for that period in the shared calendar.

## Payday[#](#payday)
Payday for a set month is generally done between the 15th and 20th of the next month.
