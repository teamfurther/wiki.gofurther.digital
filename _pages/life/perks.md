Working at Further does come with a couple of perks. Being a small company we don't offer gym memberships or provided lunch. Instead we try to focus on perks which are in alignment with our company values: personal development, constant learning and work-life balance.

## Flexi-time[#](#flexi-time)

At Further we believe our team should be allowed to handle whatever life throws at them. Although we follow traditional 9 to 5 business hours, we encourage you to take a couple of hours off whenever you need to run a couple of errands or to baby-sit. 

We trust you'll make up for this time and make sure deadlines are met. The only thing we request is that, if possible, you either stay accessible in reach for urgent matters or let us know in advance that you will be off-grid in the ```#general``` Slack channel. 

## Holidays and leaves[#](#holidays-and-leaves)

Regular time off is essential in order to maintain a healthy work-life balance and avoid burnout. We don't want you to worry about counting the paid vacation days you've got left, so we provide unlimited:
- sick leave
- parental leave
- paid holidays

As with flexi-time, we ask you to let us know in advance of your holiday plans. We welcome if you notify us the sooner, the longer the planned holiday will be. This way we can plan ahead an not over-extend ourselves.

Remember, having unlimited holidays is not enough if you don't use them. We recommend taking at least 3 weeks vacation per year.

### National holidays

Since our team works remotely from different countries, we naturally observe different national holidays. Let us know in advance which national holidays you wish to celebrate.

## Remote work[#](#remote-work) 

Whether you wish to work from home, a coffee shop or a co-working office, remote work is our second nature. No questions asked.

## Personal development allowance[#](#personal-development-allowance)

Constant learning and personal development is really important for us. In order to help you achieve this, we provide an allowance which you can use for:
- books, e-books, audio books
- online courses, tutorial
- conference tickets
- language courses
- etc.

Please let us know of your purchases beforehand so we can handle billing. Afterwards, please track your purchases in the allowances spreadsheets.

If you leave the company within 6 months of the purchase, Further is entitled to a full refund of the costs.
 
## Productivity allowance[#](#productivity-allowance) 

If you're not productive, it's not only bad for the company, but it's also frustrating to you. To avoid this, we provide you with a productivity allowance, which you can use for:
- software licences
- hardware (laptop, headset, etc.)
- desk in a co-working office
- etc.

Please let us know of your purchases beforehand so we can handle billing. Afterwards, please track your purchases in the allowances spreadsheets.
